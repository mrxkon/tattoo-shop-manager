A simple yet powerful Tattoo Shop Manager.

== Description ==

**Tattoo Shop Manager** is a simple yet powerful [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/ "WordPress") plugin that adds full functionality into the WordPress Admin panel to manage all the major aspects of a Tattoo Shop. 

I'm a Tattoo Artist / Web Developer and a shop owner so I originally created this for personal use on my shop and thought it was time to make it public. This plugin is based on personal needs / experience of what information I wanted but feel free to ask for updates or changes to make it even better.

You can show your love & support by donating if you like.
