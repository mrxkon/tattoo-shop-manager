A simple yet powerful Tattoo Shop Manager.

== Description ==

**Tattoo Shop Manager** is a simple yet powerful [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/ "WordPress") plugin that adds full functionality into the WordPress Admin panel to manage all the major aspects of a Tattoo Shop. 

I'm a Tattoo Artist / Web Developer and a shop owner so I originally created this for personal use on my shop and thought it was time to make it public. This plugin is based on personal needs / experience of what information I wanted but feel free to ask for updates or changes to make it even better.

You can show your love & support by donating if you like.

Yes it is totally free and open source and there is no paid alternative option. If you enjoy it you can always show some love and support by donating.
