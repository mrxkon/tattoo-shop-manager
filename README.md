### Description

**Tattoo Shop Manager** is a simple yet powerful [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/ "WordPress") plugin that adds full functionality into the WordPress Admin panel to manage all the major aspects of a Tattoo Shop. 

I'm a Tattoo Artist / Web Developer and a shop owner so I originally created this for personal use on my shop and thought it was time to make it public. This plugin is based on personal needs / experience of what information I wanted but feel free to ask for updates or changes to make it even better.

*This plugin requires [Meta Box](http://metabox.io/ "Meta Box") to work.*

*Many thanks to [Gregory - chmln](https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr "chmln Github") for his datetime picker [Flatpickr](https://github.com/chmln/flatpickr "Flatpickr").*
